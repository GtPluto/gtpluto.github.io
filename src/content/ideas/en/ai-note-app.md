# The Problem: The Graveyard of Thoughts

We all have random thoughts throughout the day—ideas for a project, philosophical musings, psychological self-observations, or just a sudden spark of inspiration. We capture them in notes, but often, that's where they die.

Most note-taking apps are good at **capture** but terrible at **synthesis**. We end up with a "graveyard" of unconnected notes, making it hard to build upon previous ideas or see the bigger picture.

# The Solution: Contextual Resonance

I envision an AI-assisted note app that acts not just as a storage bin, but as a **thinking partner**. The core workflow is simple: you type any thought, on any topic, and the AI works in the background to organize and connect it.

## 1. Real-time Connection (The "Pop-up")
While you are typing, the AI analyzes the semantic meaning of your current thought and instantly surfaces two types of information:

*   **Relevant Past Notes**: "Hey, this sounds similar to what you wrote 3 months ago." This helps you build upon existing ideas, avoid duplication, and rediscover forgotten insights. It acts as a proactive search engine that knows what you need before you ask.
*   **Project Summaries**: If your current thought strongly relates to an existing cluster (e.g., "Project X"), the AI pops up the current summary of that project.

## 2. Auto-Clustering & Living Summaries
You shouldn't have to manually organize folders. The AI automatically detects when multiple notes revolve around the same theme (e.g., "My Dream App," "Stoicism," "Fitness Plan") and clusters them together.

For each cluster, the AI maintains a **Living Summary**. As you add a new note to a cluster, the summary updates in real-time to reflect the latest development.

# The Goal

The ultimate purpose of this app is to transform a chaotic stream of consciousness into **actionable structures**. It allows you to dump random thoughts freely, knowing that the system will catch them, connect them, and present them back to you as a coherent whole when you're ready to take action.

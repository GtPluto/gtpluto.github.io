# BetaFlow

**BetaFlow** is an iOS application designed to be a personal bouldering coach in your pocket. It bridges the gap between unstructured climbing sessions and professional coaching by providing a clear, level-based skill progression system.

## Core Concept

The fundamental problem BetaFlow solves is the "plateau" caused by a lack of technical knowledge. Climbers often know *what* grade they climb, but not *what* skills they are missing to reach the next level.

BetaFlow organizes bouldering knowledge into a structured "Skill Tree" mapped to V-grades.

### The Skill Progression System

The app is divided into difficulty tiers. Each tier contains a curated set of fundamental skills required to master that level.

*   **V-Intro - V1 (Foundations)**:
    *   Basic Grasp types (jugs, crimps).
    *   Safety: How to fall properly.
    *   Footwork basics.
*   **V1 - V3 (Efficiency)**:
    *   Straight arms (energy conservation).
    *   Hip positioning (keeping close to the wall).
    *   Basic flagging.
*   **V3 - V5 (Technique)**:
    *   Heel hooks and toe hooks.
    *   Drop knees.
    *   Dynamic movement basics.
*   **V5 - V7 (Advanced)**:
    *   Complex body tension.
    *   Micro-beta optimization.
*   **V7 - V9 (Elite)**:
    *   Specific strength application.
    *   Advanced dynamic coordination.
*   **V9+ (Mastery)**:
    *   Pro-level nuances and training.

## Key Features

### 1. AI-Curated Instruction
Instead of relying solely on manually filmed content, BetaFlow uses **YouTube Agents** to fetch, analyze, and curate the best existing instruction videos for each specific skill. This ensures the content is diverse and high-quality without a massive initial content production bottleneck.

### 2. High-Fidelity Visualizations (Nano Banana Pro)
For precise skill demonstration, the app utilizes **Nano Banana Pro** to generate detailed, clear videos. These visualizations isolate the specific movement (e.g., a "Drop Knee") to thoroughly illustrate the mechanics, physics, and body positioning in a way that messy real-world video sometimes misses.

### 3. Progress Tracking
Climbers can mark skills as "Done" once they feel confident. This simple checklist mechanic helps users visualize their knowledge gaps.

## Future Roadmap (V2+)

### Gamification
To increase engagement and motivation, future versions will incorporate "Game Psychology" elements:
*   **Skill Trees**: Visualizing progress like an RPG tech tree.
*   **XP & Levels**: Quantifying technical knowledge growth.
*   **Boss Battles**: Challenges to "unlock" the next grade tier.

### AI Feedback Loop
*   **Computer Vision Analysis**: Users will be able to upload videos of themselves climbing. The app will use AI to compare their form against the ideal model and provide specific feedback (e.g., "Your hips were too far from the wall").
